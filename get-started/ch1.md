## Language Specification

### The Web Rules Everything About (JS)

### Not All (Web) JS...

Is this code a JS program?

```js
alert("Hello, JS!");
```

Alert is not in js spec, but Various JS environments (like browser JS engines, Node.js, console)
add APIs into the global scope of your JS programs that give you environment-specific capabilities,
like being able to pop an alert-style box in the user's browser.

_js is a programming language that runs inside environment[web, console, node, etc], an based on each environment behavior may differ because environment can add additional js capabilities like alert_

### It's Not Always JS

_because of the previous stmt, js is accused of inconsistency, but it's the environment what causes this illusion_

The developer console is not trying to pretend to be a JS compiler that handles your entered code exactly the same way the JS engine handles a .js file. It's trying to make it easy for you to quickly enter a few lines of code and see the results immediately. These are entirely different use cases, and as such, it's unreasonable to expect one tool to handle both equally.

Don't trust what behavior you see in a developer console as representing *exact* to-the-letter JS semantics; for that, read the specification. Instead, think of the console as a "JS-friendly" environment. That's useful in its own right.

## Many Faces

JavaScript is most definitely a multi-paradigm language. You can write procedural, class-oriented, or FP-style code, and you can make those decisions on a line-by-line basis instead of being forced into an all-or-nothing choice.

## Backwards & Forwards

- they follow "we don't break the web" mind set for 25 years, which causes burden (with very causious exceptions)

- JS is not forwards-compatible <older browser support for JS new syntax or API>, despite many wishing such, and even incorrectly believing the myth that it is.

### Jumping the Gaps

- Since JS is not forwards-compatible. eg: If you run a program that uses an ES2019 feature in an engine from 2016, you're very likely to see the program break and crash.

For new and incompatible syntax, the solution is transpiling <using a tool to convert the source code of a program from one form to another>
- forwards-compatibility problems related to syntax are solved by using a transpiler <Babel>
- help developer to forget about forward bc compatibility

### Filling the Gaps

since syntax issue is fixed, this issue is with API then, the most common solution is:
 to provide a definition for that missing API method that stands in and
 acts as if the older environment had already had it natively defined.
 This pattern is called a polyfill (aka "shim").

Transpilers like Babel typically detect which polyfills your code needs and provide them automatically for you. But occasionally you may need to include/define them explicitly, which works similar to the snippet we just looked at.

## What's in an Interpretation?

Q: JS interpreted script or a compiled program?
A: short answer interpreted, But the truth is more complicated than that.

- "interpreted" languages have been looked down on as inferior compared to their compiled counterparts

reasons
- lack of performance optimization
- dislike of certain language characteristics eg: dynamic typing instead of the "more mature" statically typed languages.
- compiled lang usually produce a portable (binary) representation of the program that is distributed for execution later.

In scripted or interpreted languages, an error on line 5 of a program won't be discovered until lines 1 through 4 have already executed. Notably, the error on line 5 might be due to a runtime condition, such as some variable or value having an unsuitable value for an operation, or it may be due to a malformed statement/command on that line. Depending on context, deferring error handling to the line the error occurs on may be a desirable or undesirable effect.

Compare that to languages which do go through a processing step (typically, called parsing) before any execution occurs, as illustrated in Figure 2:

<figure>
    <img src="images/fig2.svg" width="650" alt="Parsing, compiling, and executing a program" align="center">
    <figcaption><em>Fig. 2: Parsing + Compilation + Execution</em></figcaption>
    <br><br>
</figure>

In this processing model, an invalid command (such as broken syntax) on line 5 would be caught during the parsing phase, before any execution has begun, and none of the program would run. For catching syntax (or otherwise "static") errors, generally it's preferred to know about them ahead of any doomed partial execution.

So what do "parsed" languages have in common with "compiled" languages? First, all compiled languages are parsed. So a parsed language is quite a ways down the road toward being compiled already. In classic compilation theory, the last remaining step after parsing is code generation: producing an executable form.

Once any source program has been fully parsed, it's very common that its subsequent execution will, in some form or fashion, include a translation from the parsed form of the program—usually called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)—to that executable form.

In other words, parsed languages usually also perform code generation before execution, so it's not that much of a stretch to say that, in spirit, they're compiled languages.

JS source code is parsed before it is executed. The specification requires as much, because it calls for "early errors"—statically determined errors in code, such as a duplicate parameter name—to be reported before the code starts executing. Those errors cannot be recognized without the code having been parsed.

So **JS is a parsed language**, but is it *compiled*?

The answer is closer to yes than no. The parsed JS is converted to an optimized (binary) form, and that "code" is subsequently executed (Figure 2); the engine does not commonly switch back into line-by-line execution (like Figure 1) mode after it has finished all the hard work of parsing—most languages/engines wouldn't, because that would be highly inefficient.

To be specific, this "compilation" produces a binary byte code (of sorts), which is then handed to the "JS virtual machine" to execute. Some like to say this VM is "interpreting" the byte code. But then that means Java, and a dozen other JVM-driven languages, for that matter, are interpreted rather than compiled. Of course, that contradicts the typical assertion that Java/etc are compiled languages.

Interestingly, while Java and JavaScript are very different languages, the question of interpreted/compiled is pretty closely related between them!

Another wrinkle is that JS engines can employ multiple passes of JIT (Just-In-Time) processing/optimization on the generated code (post parsing), which again could reasonably be labeled either "compilation" or "interpretation" depending on perspective. It's actually a fantastically complex situation under the hood of a JS engine.

So what do these nitty-gritty details boil down to? Step back and consider the entire flow of a JS source program:

1. After a program leaves a developer's editor, it gets transpiled by Babel, then packed by Webpack (and perhaps half a dozen other build processes), then it gets delivered in that very different form to a JS engine.

2. The JS engine parses the code to an AST.

3. Then the engine converts that AST to a kind-of byte code, a binary intermediate representation (IR), which is then refined/converted even further by the optimizing JIT compiler.

4. Finally, the JS VM executes the program.

To visualize those steps, again:

</figure>

Is JS handled more like an interpreted, line-by-line script, as in Figure 1, or is it handled more like a compiled language that's processed in one-to-several passes first, before execution (as in Figures 2 and 3)?

I think it's clear that in spirit, if not in practice, **JS is a compiled language**.

And again, the reason that matters is, since JS is compiled, we are informed of static errors (such as malformed syntax) before our code is executed. That is a substantively different interaction model than we get with traditional "scripting" programs, and arguably more helpful!

### Web Assembly (WASM)

## *Strict*ly Speaking

Back in 2009 with the release of ES5, JS added *strict mode* as an opt-in mechanism for encouraging better JS programs.

The benefits of strict mode far outweigh the costs, but old habits die hard and the inertia of existing (aka "legacy") code bases is really hard to shift. So sadly, more than 10 years later, strict mode's *optionality* means that it's still not necessarily the default for JS programmers.

Why strict mode? Strict mode shouldn't be thought of as a restriction on what you can't do, but rather as a guide to the best way to do things so that the JS engine has the best chance of optimizing and efficiently running the code. Most JS code is worked on by teams of developers, so the *strict*-ness of strict mode (along with tooling like linters!) often helps collaboration on code by avoiding some of the more problematic mistakes that slip by in non-strict mode.

Most strict mode controls are in the form of *early errors*, meaning errors that aren't strictly syntax errors but are still thrown at compile time (before the code is run). For example, strict mode disallows naming two function parameters the same, and results in an early error. Some other strict mode controls are only observable at runtime, such as how `this` defaults to `undefined` instead of the global object.

Rather than fighting and arguing with strict mode, like a kid who just wants to defy whatever their parents tell them not to do, the best mindset is that strict mode is like a linter reminding you how JS *should* be written to have the highest quality and best chance at performance. If you find yourself feeling handcuffed, trying to work around strict mode, that should be a blaring red warning flag that you need to back up and rethink the whole approach.

Strict mode is switched on per file with a special pragma (nothing allowed before it except comments/whitespace):

```js
// only whitespace and comments are allowed
// before the use-strict pragma
"use strict";
// the rest of the file runs in strict mode
```

| WARNING: |
| :--- |
| Something to be aware of is that even a stray `;` all by itself appearing before the strict mode pragma will render the pragma useless; no errors are thrown because it's valid JS to have a string literal expression in a statement position, but it also will silently *not* turn on strict mode! |

Strict mode can alternatively be turned on per-function scope, with exactly the same rules about its surroundings:

```js
function someOperations() {
    // whitespace and comments are fine here
    "use strict";

    // all this code will run in strict mode
}
```

Interestingly, if a file has strict mode turned on, the function-level strict mode pragmas are disallowed. So you have to pick one or the other.

The **only** valid reason to use a per-function approach to strict mode is when you are converting an existing non-strict mode program file and need to make the changes little by little over time. Otherwise, it's vastly better to simply turn strict mode on for the entire file/program.

Many have wondered if there would ever be a time when JS made strict mode the default? The answer is, almost certainly not. As we discussed earlier around backwards compatibility, if a JS engine update started assuming code was strict mode even if it's not marked as such, it's possible that this code would break as a result of strict mode's controls.

However, there are a few factors that reduce the future impact of this non-default "obscurity" of strict mode.

For one, virtually all transpiled code ends up in strict mode even if the original source code isn't written as such. Most JS code in production has been transpiled, so that means most JS is already adhering to strict mode. It's possible to undo that assumption, but you really have to go out of your way to do so, so it's highly unlikely.

Moreover, a wide shift is happening toward more/most new JS code being written using the ES6 module format. ES6 modules assume strict mode, so all code in such files is automatically defaulted to strict mode.

Taken together, strict mode is largely the de facto default even though technically it's not actually the default.
